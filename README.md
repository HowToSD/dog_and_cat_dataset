# HowToSD Dog & Cat Dataset
This repository contains synthetically generated images of dogs and cats. It serves as a tutorial companion for training image classification models using the [ComfyUI Data Analysis](https://github.com/HowToSD/ComfyUI-Data-Analysis) image classification model node.

## Image Generation Details
All images were generated using:

* **Generation tool:** ComfyUI  
* **Model:** epiCRealism Pure Evolution V5 by epinikion  

## Intended Use
* Training basic image classification models  

## Not Suitable For
* Using as a reference for realistic dogs or cats
* Training a generative model (as the images are not sufficiently realistic or accurate)  

## Known Issues
* Realism variesâ€”some images appear realistic, while others do not.  
* Some images may contain artifacts.  
* Anatomical inaccuracies may be present (e.g., incorrect tail positioning).
